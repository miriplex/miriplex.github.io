    <!-- Project Description for Chemistry Practice App -->
    <section id="project">
        <h1>A - Exam (Оге на 5 in Russian)</h1>
        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 2019 - 2020</p>
        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Chemistry Practice App was developed as a tool for Russian chemistry students to prepare for exams. It generated quizzes based on a practice book I co-authored with my chemistry teacher, focusing on key exam topics. The app allowed students to track performance, identify weak areas, and focus on improvement.</p>

<h3>Development & Challenges</h3>
<p>The Chemistry Practice App started as an ambitious project to help Russian students prepare for their chemistry exams. Initially, I chose Unity as the development platform because I was already familiar with it from my game development projects that I made for fun. However, it soon became clear that Unity was not suited for this kind of mobile application.</p><br>

<p><strong>Challenges with Unity:</strong><br>
While Unity is great for games, it was overkill for an app like this. The app was heavy, consuming too many resources, and leading to performance issues like lag and excessive battery consumption. Additionally, the app's size was far too large for what it was offering. This created a poor user experience, especially for students who needed a simple and efficient tool to study.</p><br>

<p><strong>Switching to Android Studio:</strong><br>
Realizing the limitations of Unity for this kind of project, I made the decision to switch to Android Studio, which was specifically designed for mobile app development. This transition was not easy — it required rewriting the app from scratch on a computer language (Java) and platform that I was not familiar with. But it proved to be the right decision. By switching to Android Studio, I was able to reduce the app's size by almost ten times as well as making it much more efficient and user-friendly.</p><br>

<p><strong>Graphing Performance Data:</strong><br>
One of the most important features of the app was the ability for students to track their performance over time. I integrated a graphing library that allowed users to visualize their test results and progress and displayed their problematic areas of chemistry. This feature not only helped users focus on weak spots but also gave them a sense of progression.</p><br>

<p><strong>Final Outcome:</strong><br>
After completing the app's development, I uploaded it to the Google Play Store, where it gained over 7,500 downloads from students looking to improve their chemistry skills. However, after some time, I decided to discontinue support as I moved on to other projects. As a result, the app was later removed from the Play Store.</p><br>


        <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Unity (initial development)</li>
            <li>Android Studio (final development)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
        <p>This project taught me the importance of selecting the right platform before development. I also learned how to optimize apps for better performance and user experience.</p>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>This project reinforced my passion for building tools that make a difference. It also deepened my understanding of app optimization and user experience design, skills I am eager to apply in larger-scale projects.</p>
