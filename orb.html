    <!-- Project Description for Chemistry Practice App -->
    <section id="project">
        <h1>Chemistry Practice App</h1>
        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 2019 - 2020</p>
        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Chemistry Practice App was developed as a tool for Russian chemistry students to prepare for exams. It generated quizzes based on a practice book I co-authored with my chemistry teacher, focusing on key exam topics. The app allowed students to track performance, identify weak areas, and focus on improvement.</p>
        
        <h3>Development Journey</h3>
        <p>I initially built the app using Unity, but after realizing it was too resource-heavy, I switched to Android Studio. This reduced the app's size by ten times and significantly improved performance. In Android Studio, I integratesd a graphing library to track user performance statistics.</p>

        <h3>Challenges & Solutions</h3>
        <p>Unity was familiar but led to performance issues on mobile devices. By switching to Android Studio, I optimized the app, significantly reducing size and battery consumption. I used a graphing library to display user statistics and performance trends, helping students identify areas for improvement.</p>

        <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Unity (initial development)</li>
            <li>Android Studio (final development)</li>
            <li>Graphing Library for user stats</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
        <p>This project taught me the importanc we of selecting the right platform before development. I also learned how to optimize apps for better performance and user experience.</p>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>This project reinforced my passion for building tools that make a difference. It also deepened my understanding of app optimization and user experience design, skills I am eager to apply in larger-scale projects.</p>
